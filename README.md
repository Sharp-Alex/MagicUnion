# MagicUnion
MS VisualStudio extension for generating discriminated union in C#.

In contrast to C++ and F# for instance, the C# does not have discriminated unions. Unions are awesome feature [[1]](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/discriminated-unions/). It's really frustrating, first of all because it forces developer to type unnecessary hundreds lines of code and secondary because it is certainly not even a small technical problem for Microsoft to implement them in C#. So the aim of this VS extension was to generate union as a separate class.
