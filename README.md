# MagicUnion
MS VisualStudio extension for generating discriminated union in C#.

In contrast to C++ and F# for instance, the C# does not have discriminated unions. Unions are awsome feature. It's really frustrating, first of all because it forces developer to type unnecessary hundrets of line of code and secondary becaues it is certainly not even a small technical problem for Microsoft to implement them in C#. So the aim of this VS extension was to generate union as a separate class.
