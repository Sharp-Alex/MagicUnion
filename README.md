# MagicUnion
MS VisualStudio extension for generating discriminated union in C#.
Unions are awesome feature and you can read what they can bring to you here:[[1]](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/discriminated-unions/). 
In contrast to C++ and F# for instance, the C# does not have discriminated unions.Unions are the number one in ["The 8 most missing features in C#"](https://tooslowexception.com/the-8-most-missing-features-in-c/). 
It's really frustrating, first of all because it forces developer to type unnecessary hundreds lines of code and secondary because it is certainly not even a technical problem for Microsoft to implement them in C#. So the aim of this VS extension was to generate union as a separate class when developer needs a new union.

The example of how to use this extension is in MagicUnion/MagicUnion.Test/MagicUnionTest.cs.
